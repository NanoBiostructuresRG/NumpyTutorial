## Description
**NumPy Tutorial** is a hands-on tutorial designed to introduce you to **NumPy** and to good programming practices in Python. 
It combines explanations, examples, and exercises to help you learn how to work with NumPy arrays, perform basic linear algebra operations, and write more reliable code through testing and debugging.

The tutorial is organized into three main parts:
- **Part 1:** Introduction to NumPy (arrays, vector and matrix operations, linear algebra, polynomial multiplication, etc.)
- **Part 2:** Introduction to Assert Statements and Testing (how to test your code and check numerical results safely)
- **Part 3:** Debugging Your Code (common errors, reading error messages, and practical debugging strategies)

Throughout the notebook, you will find guided exercises and test cases that encourage you to actively practice what you learn.

## Purpose
The purpose of this notebook is to help you:

- Become comfortable using **NumPy** for numerical computing  
- Understand and apply **basic linear algebra** operations in Python  
- Learn how to **test your code** using `assert` statements and NumPy’s testing tools  
- Develop **debugging skills** to find and fix errors more effectively  
- Build confidence in writing **correct, readable, and maintainable** scientific Python code  

This notebook is meant to be a **learning resource**, not a final reference. 
It is best used by working through the sections in order, running the examples, and solving the exercises yourself.
