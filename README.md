## Description
This **NumpyTutorial** is a hands-on guide designed to introduce you to **NumPy** and to good programming practices in Python. Throughout the material, you will find guided examples and a series of exercises and test cases that encourage you to actively practice what you learn, while you perform basic linear algebra operations and write more reliable code through testing and debugging.


The tutorial is organized into three main parts:
1. **Part 1:** Introduction to NumPy
    1. Importing NumPy
    2. Basic Structure of the Code
    3. NumPy Arrays
    4. Shape of Numpy Arrays
    5. Accessing NumPy Arrays
    6. Operations on NumPy Arrays
    7. Linear Algebra
    8. Saving and Loading Data with .npy and .npz Files


2. **Part 2:** Introduction to Assert Statements and Testing 

3. **Part 3:** Debugging Your Code

## Purpose
The purpose of this notebook is to help you:

- Become comfortable using **NumPy** for numerical computing  
- Understand and apply **basic linear algebra** operations in Python  
- Learn how to **test your code** using `assert` statements and NumPy’s testing tools  
- Develop **debugging skills** to find and fix errors more effectively  
- Build confidence in writing **correct, readable, and maintainable** scientific Python code  

This notebook is meant to be a **learning resource**, not a final reference. 
It is best used by working through the sections in order, running the examples, and solving the exercises yourself.
