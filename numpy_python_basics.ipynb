    "## How to work\n",
    "1. **Open the notebook**: Click on the \"Open in Colab\" button or use the link provided to open the tutorial in **Google Colab**.\n",
    "2. **Create your workspace**: Once open, go to **File > Save a copy in Drive**. This is vital! You must work on your own copy to ensure your progress is saved.\n",
    "    - **Tip**: Look at the top-left corner. If you see \"Copy of...\", you are ready to go!\n",
    "3. **Solve the exercises**: Complete the missing parts of the code where indicated. You can run each cell to test your progress (Shift + Enter).\n",
    "4. When you finish:\n",
    "    - **Rename** your file following the convention:\n",
    "        - `YourName_YourID_numpy_python_basics.ipynb`\n",
    "    - **Download the file**: Go to File > Download > Download .ipynb.\n",
    "    - **Upload** the downloaded file to the **CANVAS assignment module**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Do not** modify the notebook structure or function signatures unless explicitly stated.\n",
